Branding assets of APIs.guru project

If you're using APIs.guru we would appreciate if you help us to spread the word about it.
It's not mandatory, but definitely helps us to grow bigger and entire API ecosystem will benefit from it.

Pages which show some info from our catalog could have one of the following links:
 - **Powered by \<LOGO\>**
 - **API specs supplied by \<LOGO\>**

All such links should point to http://APIs.guru

You should use only official logos:

| [Logo]| [Horizontal logo]| [Vertical logo]|
|-------|------------------|----------------|
|![Logo]|![Horizontal logo]|![Vertical logo]|

The correct way to write our name is **APIs.guru** with exact this combination of uppercase and lowercase letters.
We recommended using the [Sansation](http://www.dafont.com/sansation.font) font, or simply use logo with name included.

If you want to write article or blog post, please use our banner image:

Please add **"How can I request/add/fix an API?"** section into customer documentation or FAQ.
<BR>**TBD**: Create sample text.
